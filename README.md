# Counter App Built with React
This counter app has four button, the increment, decrement, reset and setvalue button. When user click on the increment, the value with increase by 1 and decrease by 1 when the decrement value is clicked. The reset value will take the value back to 0 when clicked on while the set value can be used to set a value and then apply any of the other three button on it.
This app was built with React using a custom hook and useReducer. When building the app, I faced some difficulties in using custom hook as a newbie in the coding world but I was able to solve it after consulting my circle member, YouTube videos and other resourses online.
# How to use
You can visit the app using the link above and click the decrement button to minus 1 from the value on the screen (the default value is 0), click increment to add 1 to it and click reset to take the value on the screen back to the default value 0. Use the set value field to set your prefered number.
